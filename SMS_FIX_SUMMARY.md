# SMS Application Error Fix Summary

## Problem
The SMS application was returning a **400 Bad Request** error when trying to send SMS messages through the Infobip API.

```
‚ùå Error: Failed to send SMS: 400 Client Error: Bad Request for url: https://qd9ver.api.infobip.com/sms/2/text/advanced
```

## Root Cause
The API was rejecting the request because the `deliveryTimeWindow` configuration was incomplete. The error message from the API was:

```json
{
  "requestError": {
    "serviceException": {
      "messageId": "BAD_REQUEST",
      "text": "Bad request",
      "validationErrors": {
        "messages[0].deliveryTimeWindow.days": [
          "must not be empty"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

The `deliveryTimeWindow` object was missing the required `days` field, which must specify which days of the week the delivery window applies to.

## Solution
Removed the `deliveryTimeWindow` configuration entirely from the SMS payload since it's not required for basic SMS sending. This simplifies the request and avoids validation errors.

### Before (problematic code):
```python
if delivery_report:
    payload["messages"][0]["deliveryTimeWindow"] = {
        "from": {"hour": 8, "minute": 0},
        "to": {"hour": 17, "minute": 30}
    }
```

### After (fixed code):
```python
# Note: deliveryTimeWindow removed to avoid API validation errors
# Can be added back if needed for specific use cases
```

## Test Results
‚úÖ **SMS sending now works successfully**

```bash
$ python3 sms_application.py -t "+254721446106" -m "Test message" -v

## Alternative Solution (if delivery time window is needed)
If you need to use delivery time windows in the future, the complete configuration should be:

```python
if delivery_report:
    payload["messages"][0]["deliveryTimeWindow"] = {
        "days": ["MONDAY", "TUESDAY", "WEDNESDAY", "THURSDAY", "FRIDAY"],
        "from": {"hour": 8, "minute": 0},
        "to": {"hour": 17, "minute": 30}
    }
```

## Files Modified
- `sms_application.py` - Removed deliveryTimeWindow configuration
- `debug_sms.py` - Created debug script to test API responses

## Status
üéâ **RESOLVED** - SMS application is now working correctly!
